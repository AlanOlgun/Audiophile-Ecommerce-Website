### What I learned

In this project, I discovered that I could code faster using the React.js library.
I started coding by separating the sections into separate files as Components.


### Useful resources

- [React Animation](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#caveatsm) - This animation library helped me to make animation with React.Js very quickly and easily. I really like this pattern and will use it from now on..
- [Css Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Actually, I can use Css Flexbox very well, but sometimes when I can't remember the tag names, I can refresh my knowledge by quickly browsing this website.
